# The birth of RPEPE

The birth of RPEPE, the native token of the Red Pepe platform, was an exciting moment for the team behind the platform. The token was created with the goal of providing several advantages to its users, including investors who want to participate in the web3 sports betting platform.

The creation of RPEPE was necessary to enable the platform to function fully in a decentralized environment. As a BEP-20 token, RPEPE runs on the Binance Smart Chain and provides users with a variety of benefits, including reduced fees and faster transaction times.

One of the significant advantages of holding RPEPE is that it serves as a utility token on the platform. This means that users can use the token to place bets on sports events, participate in the decentralized betting exchange, and earn rewards for staking their tokens.

Additionally, RPEPE holders can benefit from the platform's governance mechanism. As a governance token, RPEPE allows holders to participate in decision-making processes related to the platform's development and evolution. This enables investors to have a say in the direction the platform takes and can help shape the future of Red Pepe.

Finally, RPEPE is deflationary, meaning that it will become scarcer over time as tokens are burned, reducing the overall supply. This can lead to an increase in the token's value over time, benefiting those who hold it.

In summary, RPEPE offers several advantages to investors who want to participate in the Red Pepe platform. As a utility token, it can be used for betting and staking, while also providing governance rights to its holders. Additionally, its deflationary mechanism can lead to an increase in value over time, making it an attractive investment option for those interested in web3 sports betting.
